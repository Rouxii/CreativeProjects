gallery of creative projects for sharing

generate_galleries.py python script generates pages and the main index.
pulls information from the projects/ folder and generates projects/pages/ content

each subfolder of projects must have a folder named KEY/ with a key.json file, and a key.jpg file to define the information for that project and how it shows up.
